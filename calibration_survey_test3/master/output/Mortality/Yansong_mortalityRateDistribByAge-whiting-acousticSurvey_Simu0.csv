"Predation (Mpred), Starvation (Mstarv), Additional mortality (Madd), Fishing (F) & Out-of-domain (Z) mortality rates per time step of saving and per size class. Z is the total mortality for migratory fish outside the simulation grid. To get annual mortality rates, sum the mortality rates within one year."
