# 'calibrar' options
# ---------------------

# This file include any option you can pass to the 'control' argument when 
# using the calibrate(..., control) call in R.
# This arguments will be parsed and passed to your calibration.
# Here we are including only the arguments you may want to change.
# The rest of the arguments have defaults, you probably do not want to change them.
# If so, set them here with care.

# The default optimization method for OSMOSE is 'AHR-ES'.
# AHR-ES: Adaptative Hierarchical Recombination Evolutionary Strategy (Oliveros-Ramos, 2014).
# It is the current default for OSMOSE calibration (and your only option so far).
# It's NOT a Genetic Algorithm. It's an Evolutionary Strategy.

method      = AHR-ES 

maxgen      = 300, 400, 500, 500 # maximum number of generations (for the ES, one value per phase)
REPORT      = 1 # level of report for the calibration (i.e. after how many iterations).
trace       = 3 # level of report (4 if you're gossip)

# WARNING: setting trace=3 or higher for AHR-ES will slow down your calibration.
# The slow-down will be proportional to a factor of (REPORT + 1)/REPORT
# You do not need trace=3 (or higher) unless your research is about the performance
# of the calibration process itself.

verbose     = TRUE # FALSE to keep it quiet, unless you are nervous and want to know everything.
