# ---------------------
# 'calibrar' options
# ---------------------

# This file include any option you can pass to the 'control' argument when 
# using the calibrate(..., control) call in R.
# This arguments will be parsed and passed to your calibration.
# Here we are including only the arguments you may want to change.
# The rest of the arguments have defaults, you probably do not want to change them.
# If so, set them here with care.

# The default optimization method for OSMOSE is 'AHR-ES'.
# AHR-ES: Adaptative Hierarchical Recombination Evolutionary Strategy (Oliveros-Ramos, 2014).
# It is the current default for OSMOSE calibration (and your only option so far).
# It's NOT a Genetic Algorithm. It's an Evolutionary Strategy.

method      = AHR-ES 

REPORT      = 1 # level of report for the calibration (i.e. after how many iterations).
trace       = 3 # level of report (4 if you're gossip)

verbose     = TRUE # FALSE to keep it quiet, unless you are nervous and want to know everything.

# WARNING: setting trace=3 or higher for AHR-ES will slow down your calibration.
# The slow-down will be proportional to a factor of (REPORT + 1)/REPORT
# You do not need trace=3 (or higher) unless your research is about the performance
# of the calibration process itself.

# TERMINATION CRITERIA: this will impact when the calibration (and each phase) is done.
#   0: maxgen reached only
#   1: maxgen reached OR max step reduction (convergence value)
#   2: relative tolerance (reltol) on function value (this is the RECOMMENDED option for OSMOSE)
#   3: maximum number of generations without improvement of best value.

maxgen  = 2000 # maximum number of generations (for the ES)
termination_criteria = 2 # recommended for OSMOSE is 2.
max_no_improvement = 10 # maximum number of generations with no improvement (according to termination criteria)

reltol = 2e-04, 1e-04, 5e-05
